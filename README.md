# Project 4

For the fourth project, I would like to take inspiration from one of the examples we reviewed in class – “A Day In The Life of a Web Designer”. I would like to make a timeline of a day in the life of my dog – Pepper! I would like to design it to look like a planner. The user will be greeted by a description of the concept of the website, followed by a story of Pepper, before being prompted to scroll through the timeline. It will start with the beginning of the day, when she wakes-up bright and early around 6:00am. It would be cute to have her pulling the covers over her head, and the cover would be the transition to the timeline. Little sliders of important events throughout the day will be available by specific hours. I want to make them sliders that you can click on and slide to reveal the animation next to the hour. It would be fun to have animations – such as a bouncing ball or shaking dog treats. This might be a little difficult to do, so I’ll have to learn how to trigger an animation when the sliders reveal the image when it expands. Perhaps reminiscent of a child’s book, I want this project to be a fun, cute, and interactive experience.
